# Phase 2 Progress Ledger

Live progress page: [`docs/progress.html`](docs/progress.html) (regenerate with `npm run progress`)

## Current target

**M1 — Textured district.** Materials + facade system wired into the streamed LOD,
budget thresholds re-derived from a fully textured chunk and logged here, lit windows
at night, bloom + height fog in.

| 2026-08-29 | budget (no traffic) | PASS — draw p95 141, stall 4.8 ms, heap −1 MB | `docs/drive.json` |
| 2026-08-29 | budget (30 stubs) | PASS — draw p95 145, stall 6.6 ms, heap −2 MB | `docs/drive-traffic.json` |

**Thresholds in force** (`tools/budget.mjs`): draw calls warn 260 / fail 400; triangles
warn 900k / fail 1.8M; chunk stall warn 8 ms / fail 16 ms; heap growth warn 40 / fail 120 MB.
Set against *untextured* extrusions in Phase 1b. **Scheduled re-derivation at M1** once the
first fully textured chunk lands (binding constraint 4).

## Threshold change log

### 2026-08-29 — re-derived against the first fully textured district (binding constraint 4)

| Metric | Was | Now | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Draw calls | warn 260 / fail 400 | **warn 200 / fail 320** | tightened |
| Triangles | warn 900k / fail 1.8M | **warn 400k / fail 900k** | tightened |
| Chunk stall | warn 8 / fail 16 ms | unchanged | — |
| Heap growth | warn 40 / fail 120 MB | unchanged | — |

**Measurements the new values are derived from** — all with 60 civilian + 10 pursuit units,
materials + facade kit + post stack live:

| Source | Draw calls | Triangles |
|---|---|---|
| Chase harness, 2 laps at speed | p95 114, max ~125 | 60.9k p95 |
| Drive-through + traffic, 3 laps | p95 111, max 121 | — |
| 9 static route cameras @ 1920×1080 | max 112 | max 37.1k |

**Rationale.** The old values were set in Phase 1b against *untextured* extrusions and were
never a real budget. warn ≈ 1.6× and fail ≈ 2.5× the measured textured worst case leaves
room for the systems still to land (signage atlas, sky dome, rain, mission props — HUD is
DOM and adds zero WebGL calls) while still failing on a structural regression such as
losing instancing or reintroducing per-object materials. Stall and heap stay principled
rather than measurement-derived: 16 ms is one frame at 60 Hz.

Both draw-call and triangle thresholds moved **down**. No gate was loosened.

## Failed approaches

| What | Why it failed | What replaced it |
|---|---|---|
| Overpass API for the OSM bake | 503s + mid-exchange tunnel resets across 4 mirrors through the container proxy | Canonical `api.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/map` bbox endpoint |
| Emissive facade mask via `getImageData` readback | 2,219 ms per 1024px texture (1M-pixel JS loop) | Single-pass: albedo + emissive drawn together, 143 ms |
| Shared scratch vector in `Vehicle.applyImpulseAt` | `offset.cross(impulse)` became a self-cross → suspension torque silently zero | Dedicated `_tq` scratch, documented as do-not-optimise |
| Per-frame steering lerp / variable timestep | Handling changed with frame rate; 30 Hz vs 120 Hz diverged ~75 m over 8 s | `stepFixed()` 120 Hz accumulator; now within 1.6 m |
| Distance-threshold "orphan" counter in traffic | Tallied frames × cars (34,864), not distinct orphans | Counts distinct cars whose chunk is genuinely not resident |
| Bayfront band as "within 220 m of trim west edge" | Band was mostly open water; caught only 15 footprints | Distance to real coastline geometry; 153 footprints |
| Synchronous chunk build with the facade kit | One chunk cost 31.2 ms; the stall gate fails at 16 ms and `budgetMs` cannot help when the granularity is a whole chunk | Resumable build: append until the frame deadline, continue next frame; gate now measures the worst uninterrupted slice |
| Per-building cost cap keyed on `floors × vertex count` | Missed the actual worst case — a four-point 737 m² tower emitting 19k trim vertices in 28.5 ms | Keyed on `floors × perimeter`, because balcony count scales with edge length not edge count |
| Recomputing the want/unload/queue scan every `update()` | 6.8 ms per call for an answer that was identical almost every time | Rescan only when the player crosses a chunk boundary |
| Mesh upload inside the same slice as geometry append | 9.8 ms of unbounded buffer creation tacked onto a slice that had already spent its budget | Upload is its own scheduled phase |
| Mesh upload as one block per chunk | The whole chunk's meshes uploaded together; worst slice 13.4 ms | Split into one-mesh steps the deadline can gate; upload fell to 2.3–3.7 ms |
| Unbounded unload loop | Crossing several chunk boundaries in one update disposed every out-of-range chunk at once — the last unbounded block | Bounded to one disposal per update, deferred through a pending map |
| One mesh pair per street lamp (233 posts = 466 meshes) | ~70% of all draw calls at worst case; chase harness measured 325 p95, 18.8% headroom | `src/streetfurniture.js`: 3 InstancedMeshes for the whole district |
| One `PointLight` per street lamp (233 live lights) | three.js forward-renders every light per fragment and compiles materials against the light count; software rendering here could never expose it | `src/lightpool.js`: fixed pool of 10 real lights reassigned to the nearest emitters, with hysteresis |
| `renderer.info.render` read directly for the budget gate | After the composite blit it describes a 1-triangle fullscreen pass — reported **1 draw call** and would have silently defeated the gate | `PostStack.stats.sceneCalls/totalCalls` snapshot taken right after the scene render |
| Traffic overlap metric with an inner-loop `break` | Several outer iterations counted the same frame; reported **119.9%** of frames | Single `overlapped` flag, counted once per frame |

## Cut-list status

Per FEASIBILITY-1B.md §6. Cuts execute bottom-up. Reaching item 4 or higher escalates.

| # | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Weather beyond rain + fog | **CUT** (per binding constraint 3) |
| 2 | Pedestrians | not cut |
| 3 | Building interiors | **CUT** (never in scope) |
| 4 | Full district height authoring | **partially cut** — corridor + mission route authored, rest defaulted (binding constraint 9, pre-approved) |
| 5 | Second LOD tier + occlusion culling | not cut |
| 6 | TAA | not cut |
| 7 | Bloom + height fog | **NEVER CUT** (binding constraint 8) |
| 8 | The two CI gates | **NEVER CUT** (binding constraint 8) |

Item 4 is marked partially cut because binding constraint 9 pre-authorises exactly that
scope ("author heights along the Marlin Street corridor and mission route; defaulted
massing acceptable elsewhere"). This is the approved plan, not an escalation.

## Critic rounds

_None yet._

## Open item for the M1 real-hardware checkpoint

The stall metric sits at **9.3 ms — a WARN, 41.9% headroom to the 16 ms fail**. Its
dominant term is a single `_dispose` measured at **8 ms**, which is WebGL buffer
deletion. That is almost certainly a SwiftShader artifact: a real driver frees buffers
far more cheaply. Everything else in the slice is now bounded and small (scan 1.1 ms,
upload 2.3–3.7 ms). **This is the first thing to re-measure on real hardware at M1.** If
it holds at ~8 ms there, chunk disposal needs a different strategy (geometry pooling);
if it collapses, the stall metric should comfortably clear the warn threshold.

## Risk 5 chase harness — running from week one

`tools/chase-harness.mjs` (`npm run chase`). Spawns the worst case — 60 civilian stubs +
10 pursuit units + the route driven at speed, forcing continuous streaming churn on the
real road graph — and asserts against the budget gate. It found three real defects on its
first run, all listed under Failed approaches above, and one of them (the
`renderer.info` read) would have silently disabled the draw-call gate for the rest of
Phase 2.

| | First run | After fixes |
|---|---|---|
| Draw calls p95 | 325 (WARN, 18.8% headroom) | **90 (PASS, 77.5% headroom)** |
| Live point lights | 233 | **10** (fixed pool over 233 emitters) |
| Lamp draw calls | ~466 meshes | **3** InstancedMeshes |

Pursuit behaviour over 2 laps: 10 active, 35 spawns, 9 lost beyond the give-up radius,
752 junction reroutes, 16 one-way dead-ends. Civilian traffic at 60 units: 659 spawns,
549 despawns, 50 dead-ends, **0 orphans**, overlap 68.7% of frames (vs 35.4% at 30 units —
the honest scaling of a stub with no following distance; M2's job).

## Next action

Integrate the six M1 builder modules as they land, then re-derive the draw-call
thresholds against the first fully textured chunk and log the change here.
